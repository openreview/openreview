# Contributing to OpenReview

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenReview!

The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved by reporting issues in OpenReview and its documentation.

## Asking Questions

The issue tracker is intended for bugs found in the system. If your question is related to how OpenReview works, rather than opening an issue, please first check our [FAQ](https://openreview.net/faq). If you cannot find the answer there, please contact the organizers of your venue or contact us at info@openreview.net.

## Providing Feedback

**Your comments and feedback are welcome**

You can use the [discussions](https://github.com/openreview/openreview/discussions) or send us an email directly to info@openreview.net.

## Reporting Issues

If you have identified a reproducible problem in OpenReview, we want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

If you have found a security vulnerability in the system, instead of opening an issue, please contact us at security@openreview.net. We will investigate and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

If you have a problem with your account that requires you to share personal information such as your email or name, please contact us at info@openreview.net.

If you have found a bug that does not compromise the system or its data, feel free to open an issue using the template to describe it as best as you can.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/openreview/openreview/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue to the best of your abililty and leave blank the ones you don't have information for. The more information you provide the easier will it be for us to reproduce the issue and fix it.

* API version (if you know it)

* Your operating system

* Your browser and its version

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (how to open the Dev Tools Console varies depending on your browser)
