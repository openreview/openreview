# Computing Affinity Scores and Conflicts for large venues

**Note:** This document is for large venues (>2000 submissions) that need to manually calculate scores and conflicts. Smaller venues should refer to the directions [here](../../workflows/conferences.md).

### Overview

The sections below give detailed step-by-step instructions on how to complete this process. Below is an overview and important information about the process.&#x20;

There are 3 steps:

1. Compute affinity scores  with `client.request_expertise(...)`
2. Upload affinity scores with  `venue.setup_committee_matching(compute_affinity_scores=...)`
3. Compute and upload conflicts with  `venue.setup_committee_matching(compute_conflicts=..., compute_conflicts_n_years=...)`&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Computing and uploading scores are two separate steps because you first have to call to the Expertise API, then retrieve the scores to upload later as CSV. However, for conflicts, `setup_committee_matching` handles both the computation and the upload of conflicts.
{% endhint %}

#### **Estimated times:**

The times depend on the number of Edges being posted. The larger the venue, the more edges you will post.

* Compute affinity scores: \~12+ hours
* Upload affinity scores: \~3+ hours
* Compute and upload conflicts: \~3+ hours
* Deleting edges: \~30+ minutes

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have good internet connection since these processes take a long time. This also means you shouldn't upload scores and compute conflicts at the same time.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Setup

Create all the necessary invitations by calling `venue.setup_committee_matching()`. This also converts the IDs in the group to profile IDs:

```python
# Use API 1 client
venue = openreview.helpers.get_conference(client_v1, request_form_id)
venue.setup_committee_matching(committee_id=venue.get_reviewers_id())
# For ACs: venue.setup_committee_matching(committee_id=venue.get_area_chairs_id())
# For SACs: venue.setup_committee_matching(committee_id=venue.get_senior_area_chairs_id())
```

### 2. Computing scores

If SACs are assigned to ACs, you can compute scores in the request form using Paper Matching Setup.

For computing any role (SACs, ACs, Reviewers, etc) against submissions, call [`client.request_expertise()`](how-to-compute-affinity-scores.md#requesting-scores-between-a-group-and-all-papers). An example request can look like the following:

```python
venue = openreview.helpers.get_conference(client_v1, request_form_id) # Use API 1 client

role = venue.get_reviewers_id() # Role to compute

# Use API 2 client
job_id = client_v2.request_expertise(
   name='venue-reviewers1', # Name of the scores
   group_id=role,
   venue_id=venue.get_submission_venue_id(),
   expertise_selection_id=f'{role}/-/Expertise_Selection',
   model='specter2+scincl'
)

```

**Returns**: A dictionary containing the job ID.&#x20;

**Parameters:**

* **`name`**: Name of the job. Make each job name unique so you can query your job later.
* **`group_id`**: The group you for which you are computing scores.
* **`venue_id`**: This refers to the submission’s `venueid` field. In this example, we are using active submissions.
  * This tells the status of the submission, so this param is how we query submissions.
* **`expertise_selection_id`**: The ID of the role’s Expertise Selection invitation.
  * This is how users exclude publications from their expertise. So this param is saying to take into account any exclusions.
* **`model`**: The expertise model used to compute scores.
  * We recommend `specter2+scincl`, but we have many models.
  * Info on models can be found [here](https://github.com/openreview/openreview-expertise?tab=readme-ov-file#model-descriptions).

You can also add an optional `weight` argument. See [Weighing Publications](how-to-compute-affinity-scores.md#weighing-publications).

#### Retrieve Job ID

```python
# Use API 2 client
res = client_v2.get_expertise_status(group_id=venue.get_reviewers_id())

for job in res['results']:
    if job['name'] == 'venue-reviewers1':
        print(job['jobId'])
```

### 3. Check the status of score computation

```python
# Use API 2 client
results = client_v2.get_expertise_status(job_id=job_id)
print(results['status'])
```

**Statuses**:

* Completed
* Error
* Running Expertise

If for any reason it errors, you can call `request_expertise` again to recompute scores.

### 4. Retrieve scores and convert to CSV

#### Retrieving scores:&#x20;

When the scores are complete, you can retrieve the scores:

```python
results = client_v2.get_expertise_results(job_id)
```

The schema of the results can be found [here](how-to-compute-affinity-scores.md).

#### Convert to CSV

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame.from_records(result['results']).to_csv('expertise_results.csv', index=False, header=False)
```

This creates a CSV with columns: Paper ID, Profile ID, Score.

### 5. Upload Scores

You can upload scores by calling [venue.setup\_committee\_matching()](how-to-compute-affinity-scores.md#uploading-scores-from-a-csv):

```python
venue = openreview.helpers.get_conference(client_v1, request_form_id) # Use API 1 client

no_profiles = venue.setup_committee_matching(
   committee_id=venue.get_reviewers_id(),
   compute_affinity_scores='expertise_results.csv'
)
print(no_profiles)
```

`setup_committee_matching` params:

* **`committee_id`**: The ID of the group for which you are uploading scores.
* **`compute_affinity_scores`**: The path to the affinity score CSV.

**Returns**: A dictionary showing users with no profiles and no publications.

* These users should either be removed or be reminded to sign up.

{% hint style="info" %}
By assignment time there should be no email members in the group.
{% endhint %}

**If uploading fails:**&#x20;

1. Delete the score edges
2. Check that the edge count is 0
3. Re-run setup\_committee\_matching

```python
# API 2 client
client_v2.delete_edges(invitation='venue.get_affinity_score_id(venue.get_reviewers_id())')

client_v2.get_edges_count(invitation='venue.get_affinity_score_id(venue.get_reviewers_id())')
```

### 6. Computing and uploading conflicts

```python
venue = openreview.helpers.get_conference(client_v1, request_form_id) # Use API 1 client

no_profiles = venue.setup_committee_matching(
   committee_id=venue.get_reviewers_id(),
   compute_conflicts='NeurIPS',
   compute_conflicts_n_years=5
)
print(no_profiles)
```

`setup_committee_matching` params:

* **`committee_id`**: The ID of the group for which you are computing conflicts.
* **`compute_conflicts`**: The conflict policy.
  * We have 2 policies: `Default` and `NeurIPS`.&#x20;
  * More information on policies can be found [here](how-to-do-automatic-assignments/how-to-setup-paper-matching-by-calculating-affinity-scores-and-conflicts.md).
* **`compute_conflicts_n_years`**: The number of years to consider when looking at a user's History.

**Returns**: A dictionary showing users with no profiles and no publications.

* These users should either be removed or be reminded to sign up.

{% hint style="info" %}
By assignment time there should be no email members in the group.
{% endhint %}

**If uploading fails**:&#x20;

1. Delete the conflict edges.
2. Check that the edge count is 0.
3. Re-run `setup_committee_matching`.

```python
# Use API 2 client
client_v2.delete_edges(invitation='venue.get_conflict_score_id(venue.get_reviewers_id())')

client_v2.get_edges_count(invitation='venue.get_conflict_score_id(venue.get_reviewers_id())')
```
