# How to deploy the proposed assignments

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want reviewers to see their assignments before the Review period starts, either wait to deploy the assignments or add the reviewers as submission readers after the start of the review period.
{% endhint %}

From the assignment page, click ‘Deploy assignments’ next to the matching configuration of your choice. Note that this will not notify group members of their assignments. You can contact different roles either [through their group consoles](../../communication/how-to-send-messages-through-the-ui.md) or [through the python client](../../communication/how-to-send-messages-with-the-python-client.md).
