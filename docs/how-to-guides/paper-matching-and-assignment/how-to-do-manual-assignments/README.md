To make manual assignments:

You can choose whether or not to calculate conflict of interest or affinity scores, but the Paper Matching Setup must be run. This process sets up the Assignment Configuration with enables you to make assignments.
2. Return to the PC console, in the "Timeline" section you can access the link to the Edge Browser to make manual assignments.
