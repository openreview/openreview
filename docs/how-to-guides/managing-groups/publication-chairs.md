# Publication Chairs

If your venue will be using publication chairs, there is an option for PCs to set up this group in the request form.

PCs have the option to add the emails of the Publication Chairs while filling out the request or they can [add the emails later](../../reference/stages/revision.md).

After the venue workflow has concluded and the PCs have run the [Post Decision Stage](../../reference/stages/post-decision-stage.md), the Publication Chairs can access their console where they will be able to view all the Accepted submissions.&#x20;
