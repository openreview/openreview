# How to enable the Review Revision Stage

The Review Revision Stage is run when PCs want reviewers to be able to modify a review by changing or adding fields.

PCs can include existing review fields in the revision fields to allow users to update those fields.&#x20;

You could also add fields to a review for reviewers to fill out, such as after the rebuttal period. These new fields are often the final rating of the paper and the justification for changing the rating.&#x20;

This stage cannot be run from the venue request page and must be requested.

To request the Review Revision Stage, please [Contact Support](https://openreview.net/contact) with the following information:

1. Start date, Due date, and Expiration date for the invitation, with the day, time, timezone for each.
2. Fields that reviewers should be able to change in the review, including existing and new fields
