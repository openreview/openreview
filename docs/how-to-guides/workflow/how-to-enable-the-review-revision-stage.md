# How to enable the Review Revision Stage

The Review Revision invitation can be create when Program Chairs want reviewers to be able to modify a posted review by changing or adding fields after the Review Stage deadline has closed.

PCs can include existing review fields in the revision fields to allow users to update those fields.

You could also add fields to a review for reviewers to fill out, such as after the rebuttal period. These new fields are often the `final_rating` of the paper and the `justification` for changing the rating.

The Review Revision can be created by Program Chairs using the [CustomStage](using-the-customstage.md). Please take a look at the example [Review Revision](using-the-customstage.md#id-2.-review-revision).
