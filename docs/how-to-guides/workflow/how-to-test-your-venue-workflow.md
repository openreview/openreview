# How to test your venue workflow

Test venues and profiles are not allowed on the live OpenReview site. You can test your venue workflow using the dev site: [dev.openreview.net](https://dev.openreview.net/). In order to do so, create a profile and [submit a venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/creating-your-venue-instance-submitting-a-venue-request-form.md), just as you would on the live site.

After submitting the request form, **you must contact us** at info@openreview.net so we can deploy the venue.

Note that sending emails through the dev site is not supported, except during profile signup so you no longer need to contact us for you activation link.
