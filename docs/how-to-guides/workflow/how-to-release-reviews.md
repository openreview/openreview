# How to release reviews

When you are ready to release the reviews, run the [Review Stage](../../reference/stages/review-stage.md) from the [venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md#venue-request-form) and update the visibility settings to determine who should be able to see them. This will change the readers of all existing reviews in bulk.&#x20;

Please note that if you want to release the reviews to the public, you will first need to make all submissions public if they are not already. If you select to release the reviews to the public while trying to release them to authors, it will not work if the submissions are not already public. If your decision stage has passed, you can use the 'Post Decision Stage' to release submissions. If you need to make submissions public but have not yet posted the decisions, contact OpenReview support at info@openreview.net for assistance.&#x20;
