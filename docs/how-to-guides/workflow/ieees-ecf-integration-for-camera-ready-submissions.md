# IEEE's eCF  Integration for Camera-Ready Submissions

For OpenReview to integrate with IEEE's Electronic Copyright Form (eCF), the program chairs will need to know their IEEE Publication Title and IEEE Art Source Code.

## Author Console

Go to the Authors group (in Edit mode) and add the following properties to the **Group UI Code** at the bottom of the group page:

1. showIEEECopyright: true,
2. IEEEPublicationTitle: “”,
3. IEEEArtSourceCode:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-25 at 2.12.51 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Save the changes, and the “CopyRight Submission” button will appear in the console for authors of the Accepted Submissions only. This means decisions must be posted and the Post Decision was run.

## Testing

If the program chairs want to test submitting the copyright form, they can do so with an Accepted submission. They’ll need to delete the submitted form on the IEEE side afterwards.
