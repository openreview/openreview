# ARR Commitment Venues

### Submitting a Request

Venues using OpenReview that are "Full ARR" or "Hybrid" now follow the same workflow. Organizers should [submit a venue request form](https://openreview.net/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support) and inform the OpenReview staff that they subscribe to ARR. &#x20;

**Full ARR venues**: this commitment forum is the only venue to be created.&#x20;

**Hybrid venues**: submit two venue request forms, one for non-ARR reviewing and another for commitment of ARR-reviews papers.

### Venue Management

Once the commitment venue is deployed, there will be a field present in the submission form named "paper\_link" for authors to commit their ARR processed papers. Here authors will simply provide the URL to the OpenReview forum of their ARR submission. This field is validated, so it will check whether the forum link exists in an ARR venue before allowing the author to submit.&#x20;

### Requesting ARR Reviews

Please [contact OpenReview Support](https://openreview.net/contact) when the submission deadline has passed and you're ready to begin the reviewing process. By default we provide readership permissions for the ARR submission forum, Official Reviews, and Meta Reviews. **Please indicate whether you want us to include author responses to the official reviews.**

OpenReview will provide read access to ARR forums of committed papers to the venue (assigned ACs and PCs) or import ARR reviews into the venue's OpenReview instance depending on the API used for the original ARR submission.&#x20;

**ARR API 1 cycles**: After the ARR notes are imported, PCs and ACs will see a new field in the submission forum titled "Migrated Link, click this link to access the imported ARR notes.

**ARR API 2 cycles**: After read access has been granted, PCs and ACs should click on the "Paper Link" to access the previous ARR forum.
