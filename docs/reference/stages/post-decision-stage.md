# Post Decision Stage

#### What it Does&#x20;

The Post Decision Stage updates the visibility and anonymity of submissions after decisions have been posted. This updates the paper's status from active to accepted/rejected.

#### When to Use it

The Post Decision Stage will only appear after the Decision Stage deadline. If you have already successfully posted all decisions but the Post Decision Stage has not yet appeared, you can re-run the Decision stage to make the deadline earlier.
