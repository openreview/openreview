# Tags

Tags are used to tag an entity with a label, a weight or both. They can add information to an entity or be used to locate a group of entities that have the same tag. Tags are also used for stats data. The Tag entity contains two main properties: `label` and `weight`. On top of that, tags have a property to indicate what entity they are tagging. For example, if they have the property `note`, then they are tagging a Note and the value of the field will have the Note id.
