# Merging Profiles

### If you know you have multiple profiles (and access to them):

1. Log in using the email address associated with any one of your profiles. Preferably, the one you want to merge the other profiles into.
2. Add the email address that is already confirmed in your other profile to the profile you're currently logged into. (You can skip to step 3 if you have already added this email address.)
3. Click on "Confirm."
4. You will receive an email to confirm the profile merge. Click on this link - make sure you are logged into the account from which you requested to do the merge.

&#x20;If you get an 'Merge Forbidden' message, try logging out, logging into the other OpenReview profile, then opening that link again.

### If you got an error during profile registration:

Sample: \[link] is already in use by \[user]

This can happen because you have previously registered an account with this information with OpenReview, or because the publication information is associated with a pre-created account.

1. Finish profile registration **without** the link that caused the error
2. Fill out the [Feedback Form](https://openreview.net/contact) and include in the message your profile ID and the profile ID that you wish to merge with.

### Other cases

If you do not recognize a profile flagged as duplicate being yours, or do not have access to the email address of the other profile, please [contact us](https://openreview.net/contact).
