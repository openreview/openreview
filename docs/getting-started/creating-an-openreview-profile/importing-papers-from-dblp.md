If you get an error that says "please ensure the provided DBLP URL is yours", make sure that the name (or one of the names) in your OpenReview profile matches **exactly** with the name used in DBLP publications. If it does not, you can [add a new name to your profile](add-or-remove-a-name-from-your-profile.md), click 'Save Profile Changes', and try again to import your papers.&#x20;

### To remove publications imported from DBLP

Go to your profile page and click 'Edit Profile'. Scroll to the bottom of the page and look for 'Publications' section. All publications associated with your profile will be listed here but those imported from DBLP will have a minus icon displayed after the title.
