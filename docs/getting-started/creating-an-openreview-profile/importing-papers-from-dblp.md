If you get an error that says "please ensure the provided DBLP URL is yours", make sure that the name (or one of the names) in your OpenReview profile matches **exactly** with the name used in DBLP publications. If it does not, you can [add a new name to your profile](add-or-remove-a-name-from-your-profile.md), click 'Save Profile Changes', and try again to import your papers.&#x20;

### To remove publications imported from DBLP

Go to your profile page and click 'Edit Profile'. Click on the 'Personal Links' section to view the publications. All publications associated with your profile will be listed here but those imported from DBLP or ORCID will have a minus icon displayed after the title.

You can use this minus button to remove a DBLP publication from your profile. If you mistakenly remove a publication, you can click the icon again to reverse it.

When you are finished, click 'Save Profile Changes' in order to remove the selected papers from your profile.&#x20;
