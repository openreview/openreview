# Signing up for OpenReview

### 1. Making or finding a profile

To create a profile, go to [https://openreview.net/signup](https://openreview.net/signup). Enter your full name as you would like it to appear in publications. A common format is: First Last



By checking the confirmation box, existing profiles with your name will be listed.

Then, take one of the following actions, depending on whether there is a pre-created account, you already have a partial or complete OpenReview Profile, or you are signing up for the first time.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
OpenReview restricts duplication of certain profile information. Users who create multiple accounts will run into errors when updating their profile, so it is recommended that you make a new account only if there is no existing account that you can claim, reset the password of, or activate.
{% endhint %}

#### Claim Profile

If a **Claim Profile** option appears, this means that there is a pre-created profile in OpenReview with your name. These are often associated with DBLP urls, and if you believe an account should belong to you, click the Claim Profile button. Enter your email, click claim, and enter a password, then proceed to the Profile Registration step.

Contact support if: you no longer have access to an email associated with the profile you need to claim, such as a past institution.

#### **Send Activation Link**&#x20;

If there is a profile created with your name, but you didn't finish the activation process, you will see this option. Enter your email address and click ‘Send Activation Link’, you will receive an email with a link that will bring you to the OpenReview [registration page](signing-up-for-openreview.md#profile-registration) (Step 2).

If you do not receive an activation email, refer to: [Resending an activation link](resending-an-activation-link.md)

#### **Reset Password**&#x20;

Existing active accounts will show up with the 'Reset Password' option, and the email domains associated with the account will be displayed. If you believe one of these is your profile, click 'Reset Password', enter your email address and click 'Reset Password' again to send a password reset email.

If you do not receive a password reset email, refer to: [I didn't receive a password reset email, what do I do?](../frequently-asked-questions/i-didnt-receive-a-password-reset-email-what-do-i-do.md)

#### **Create a new account**&#x20;

If no existing profiles belong to you and you would like to create a new one, you can fill in your email address in the text field next to the ‘Sign Up’ option and click the 'Sign Up' button. We recommend that you sign up with your institutional (university, company, or organization) email.&#x20;

If you sign up with a public domain or an email domain that is not included in our institution list you will see a warning: &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2024-01-04 at 5.02.31 PM.png" alt="The warning reads: gmail.com does not appear in our list of publishing institutions. It can take up to 2 weeks for profiles using public email services to be activated. To activate immediately, please sign up with an email address that uses an educational or employing institution domain. If your institution is not yet in our list, contact us to request that it be added."><figcaption><p>Email domain warning.</p></figcaption></figure>

If you are using an institutional email and get this warning, contact support using Feedback to ask that your domain be added to the list. Signing up with a public domain may take up to 2 weeks in moderation. See [here](expediting-profile-activation.md) for tips on expediting this process.

After typing your email you will then be prompted to enter a new password and send a confirmation email. Clicking the link in the confirmation email will bring you to the registration page.

### **2. Profile Registration**&#x20;

If you have claimed an inactive profile, resent an activation link, or created a new profile, you will receive an email with the subject 'OpenReview Signup Confirmation'. Follow the link in this email to complete your profile registration. Profile registration is a required step in order to have an active OpenReview Profile.

Providing as complete information as possible, especially an institutional email address and valid personal homepage, will help your account be activated quickly.&#x20;

A valid homepage is a website that shows your name, affiliation, and email that you used to register for OpenReview. This could be a Google Scholar profile, personal webpage, GitHub, institutional profile page, or other professional homepage.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: A landing page for an entire company, institution, or department, or a social media account that uses a screen name, is not a valid homepage
{% endhint %}

If you do not have an institutional affiliation, you may sign up as an Independent Researcher. See [here](../frequently-asked-questions/i-am-an-independent-researcher-how-do-i-sign-up.md) for detailed instructions on what to include in your profile.

#### Common issues for Profile registration:

* **Validation errors for career/education history or institutional data**:  See See [Entering Institutional Data](entering-institutional-data.md) for a detailed description and examples.
* **Relation not found in the dropdown menu**: If none of the existing relations are appropriate, you may type in a custom relationship to the textbox.
* **Homepage duplication:** If you get an error that one of your links can't be added, it is either in the wrong format or already added to another account. Check that there are no exiting or claimable accounts with your email, and if you still don't recognize the account listed in the error, contact OpenReview Support through our [Feedback form](https://openreview.net/contact).

### 3. Moderation

After clicking ‘Register for OpenReview’, your profile will either be activated immediately or sent to moderation. Moderation can take up to two weeks, but the support team reviews moderation regularly, and will follow up with additional actions necessary.&#x20;

If you receive an email indicating that additional information is required to activate your OpenReview profile, return to the Profile Registration Step by [resending the activation link](resending-an-activation-link.md), and complete the missing information. See [Expediting Profile Activation](expediting-profile-activation.md) for additional information.
