# Signing up for OpenReview

### 1. Making or finding a profile

To create a profile, go to [https://openreview.net/signup](https://openreview.net/signup). Enter your full name as you would like it to appear in publications. A common format is: First Last

By checking the confirmation box, existing profiles with your name will be listed.

Enter an email address and click the "Sign Up" button. You'll be prompted to create a password.

OpenReview restricts duplication of certain profile information. Users who create multiple accounts will run into errors when updating their profile, so it is recommended that you make a new account only if there is no existing account.

#### Existing Profile Email

If a profile registered to this email already exists, an email is sent to that address to notify them.&#x20;

#### **Resend Activation Link**

If there is a profile created with your name, but you didn't finish the activation process, you can resend the confirmation link, refer to: [Resending an activation link](resending-an-activation-link.md). Enter your email address and click ‘Didn't receive email confirmation?’, you will receive an email with a link that will bring you to the OpenReview [registration page](signing-up-for-openreview.md#profile-registration) (Step 2).

#### **Reset Password**

If you don't remember the password to your profile and your profile is active, from the [login page](https://openreview.net/login) click on the 'Forgot your password?' link. You can also visit the [Request Password Reset](https://openreview.net/reset) page to send a password reset link to your registered email.

If you do not receive a password reset email, refer to: [I didn't receive a password reset email, what do I do?](../frequently-asked-questions/i-didnt-receive-a-password-reset-email-what-do-i-do.md)

#### **Create a new account**

If you have no existing profile, to create a new one fill in your email address in the text field next to the ‘Sign Up’ option and click the 'Sign Up' button. We recommend that you sign up with your institutional (university, company, or organization) email.

If you sign up with a public domain or an email domain that is not included in our institution list you will see a warning:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-02-27 at 10.20.10 AM.png" alt="The warning reads: gmail.com does not appear in our list of publishing institutions. It can take up to 2 weeks for profiles using public email services to be activated. To activate immediately, please sign up with an email address that uses an educational or employing institution domain. If your institution is not yet in our list, contact us to request that it be added."><figcaption><p>Email domain warning.</p></figcaption></figure>

If you are using an institutional email and get this warning, please proceed with registration, we routinely add new, verified domains to the list. Signing up with a public domain may take up to 2 weeks in moderation. See [here](expediting-profile-activation.md) for tips on expediting this process.

After typing your email you will then be prompted to enter a new password and send a confirmation email. Clicking the link in the confirmation email will bring you to the registration page.

### **2. Profile Registration**

If you have resent an activation link, or created a new profile, you will receive an email with the subject 'OpenReview Signup Confirmation'. Follow the link in this email to complete your profile registration. Profile registration is a required step in order to have an active OpenReview Profile.

Providing as complete information as possible, especially an institutional email address and valid personal homepage, will help your account be activated quickly.

A valid homepage is a website that shows your name, affiliation, and email that you used to register for OpenReview. This could be a Google Scholar profile, personal webpage, GitHub, institutional profile page, or other professional homepage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: A landing page for an entire company, institution, or department, or a social media account that uses a screen name, is not a valid homepage
{% endhint %}

If you do not have an institutional affiliation, you may sign up as an Independent Researcher. See [here](../frequently-asked-questions/i-am-an-independent-researcher-how-do-i-sign-up.md) for detailed instructions on what to include in your profile.

#### Common issues for Profile registration:

* **Validation errors for career/education history or institutional data**: See See Entering Institutional Data for a detailed description and examples.
* **Homepage duplication:** If you get an error that one of your links can't be added, it is either in the wrong format or already added to another account. Check that there are no exiting profiles with your email, and if you still don't recognize the account listed in the error, contact OpenReview Support through our [Feedback form](https://openreview.net/contact).

### 3. Moderation

After clicking ‘Register for OpenReview’, your profile will either be activated immediately or sent to moderation. Moderation can take up to two weeks, but the support team reviews moderation regularly, and will follow up with additional actions necessary.

If you receive an email indicating that additional information is required to activate your OpenReview profile, return to the Profile Registration Step by [resending the activation link](resending-an-activation-link.md), and complete the missing information. See [Expediting Profile Activation](expediting-profile-activation.md) for additional information.
