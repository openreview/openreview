# Importing publication data from ORCID to your profile

**What is ORCID?**

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) is a global, not-for-profit organization that provides unique identifiers for those participating in research, scholarship, and innovation.&#x20;

Researchers primarily interact with ORCID to obtain an ORCID iD and a record unique to them. This record is populated with publication and service information added either by the researcher directly or by trusted organizations.&#x20;

### Importing ORCID records to OpenReview

{% hint style="info" %}
OpenReview will only import publication records that are "Externally Sourced", meaning they were added to the ORCID record by an institution, publisher, etc.
{% endhint %}

Importing ORCID records functions like [importing records from DBLP](importing-papers-from-dblp.md).

1. **Login to OpenReview**

You can click on the 'Login' button on the right of the navigation menu, or go to https://openreview.net/login

2. **Navigate to the profile page**

Click on your name on the right of the navigation menu and click 'Profile' from the dropdown options, or go to https://openreview.net/profile. Click 'Edit Profile'.

3. **Add an ORCID URL**

Locate the 'ORCID URL' text field under the 'Personal Links' section.

Input your ORCID iD link, and click the **"Add ORCID Papers to Profile"** button. If your ORCID iD is not valid, the button will remain unresponsive.

If your ORCID iD was valid, publications will appear in a modal window.

Use the checkbox in front of each paper to select those which you would like to import to your OpenReview profile.

Click the 'Add to your Profile' button at the bottom of the modal window to import the selected papers.

### Unlinking imported publications

1. Go to your profile page and click 'Edit Profile'. Navigate to the 'Personal Links' section.
2. All publications associated with your profile will be listed here but those imported from DBLP or ORCID will have a minus icon displayed after the title.&#x20;

3. You can use this minus button to remove a publication from your profile. If you mistakenly remove a publication, you can click the icon again to reverse it.
4. When you are finished, click 'Save Profile Changes' in order to remove the selected papers from your profile.
