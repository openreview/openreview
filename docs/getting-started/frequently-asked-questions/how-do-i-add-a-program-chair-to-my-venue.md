# How do I add a Program Chair to my venue?

After your venue is deployed, add Program Chair(s) by going to your Venue Request form, clicking the Revision button, then adding the emails of the additional program chair(s) to the **Program Chair Emails** field of the form. The user will need to have an active OpenReview profile with this email confirmed in order to access the venue.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not add members to the Program Chairs group directly. This will temporarily give the user access, but any changes to the venue configuration page will reset this group's membership to the users listed in the venue configuration page.&#x20;
