# I didn't receive a password reset email, what do I do?

There are a few common reasons why you might not have received the password reset email. You can try the following steps to debug the issue

1. Check that the email was not sent to a spam or junk folder.
2. Try sending the password reset email again and double check that there are no typos in the email.
3. Reset your password using a different email that is listed in your profile (such as personal email, previous institutional email).
