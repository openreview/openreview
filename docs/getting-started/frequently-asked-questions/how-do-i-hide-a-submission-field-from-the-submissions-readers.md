# How do I hide a submission field from the submission's readers?

As the venue organizer, you can choose to hide specific submission fields from all submission readers. When a field is hidden, it becomes visible only to the Program Chairs and to the paper authors.

**Hide a field using Post Submission**

If you want to restrict a submission's field visibility from everyone except the Program Chairs and the paper authors, you can do as follows:

1. From your venue request form, click [Post Submission](../../reference/stages/post-submission-stage.md).&#x20;
2.  Under `hide_fields`, select from the dropdown all the fields you would like to hide.&#x20;



After the submission deadline, submissions will be updated to be visible to all users selected under `submission_readers` in the request form, and all fields selected under `hide_fields` will be visible only to Program Chairs and paper authors.&#x20;
