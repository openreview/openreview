# I don't want my profile visible to the public, how do I change this?

If you don't want your profile to be publicly visible, you can uncheck the Profile Visibility setting from your Profile/Edit page. With this setting disabled, only authenticated (logged in) OpenReview users can view your profile.

1. Go to [https://openreview.net/profile/edit](https://openreview.net/profile/edit)
2. Click on "Personal Info"
3. Under "Profile Visibility", uncheck the box to hide your profile from the public



If your profile is public, unauthenticated individuals can see your:

* Name
* Personal Links
* Career & Education History
* Advisors, Relations & Conflicts (you can hide these items from your profile edit page)
* Expertise

You can see this by copying your profile link and opening it in an incognito browser.

Please note that OpenReview only displays obfuscated emails (\*\*\*\*@umass.edu) and never releases full email addresses to the public.
