# My Profile is "Limited". What does that mean?

OpenReview’s goal is to provide scientific communication to the entire global community. Initially OpenReview was not available to users in Iran, Cuba, Syria, and several other countries because our cloud service provider blocked access as a simple approach to comply with United States economic sanctions and trade laws.

Recently the OpenReview staff has done extra work to make OpenReview available in all countries, including those above. In order to comply with relevant laws, OpenReview must guarantee that none of our registered users appear in the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (OFAC) [SDN list](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/). We primarily accomplish this by looking for first-last-name matches in the list. When there is a name match, we ask for additional information that would disambiguate the OpenReview user from the person on the SDN list.

If you were notified that your profile has been limited, this means that the name on your profile matches that of a person on the SDN list. While in a limited state, you can log in to OpenReview, edit your profile, and view the same amount of data as before, but you will be unable to author any notes on the OpenReview system. This means you will be prevented from performing most common actions, including submitting to venues or posting reviews, meta-reviews, or comments. In order to reactivate your profile, you will need to do the following:

* Log in to OpenReview at https://openreview.net/login
* Navigate to your Profile at https://openreview.net/profile
* Click the Edit button.
* Find the field where you can enter your year of birth, and enter the information.
* Click Save at the bottom of the page.

OpenReview will routinely check for SDN matches, and if your birth year has been updated, your profile will return to active. Note that this change will not be immediate. If you believe you have been waiting longer than expected and your profile has not been reactivated, you can reach out to info@openreview.net to request that your profile be updated.&#x20;
