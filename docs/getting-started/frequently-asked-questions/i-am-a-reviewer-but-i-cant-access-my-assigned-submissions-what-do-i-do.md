# I am a reviewer but I can't access my assigned submissions, what do I do?

Ensure that you are logged in with an active OpenReview account that has the email the invitation was sent to added and confirmed to it. To make an OpenReview account, see [Signing up for OpenReview](../creating-an-openreview-profile/signing-up-for-openreview.md). To add an email to your account, see [Add or remove an email address from your profile](../creating-an-openreview-profile/add-or-remove-an-email-address-from-your-profile.md).

If you are logged in and are still not able to see your assigned submissions (but can see assignments under your Tasks), then reviewers have likely not been given reader access for submissions by the organizers of the venue.&#x20;

Please contact the venue organizers notifying them of the issue. The contact email can be found on the homepage of the venue.

### Missing Fields

If part of the submission is missing fields such as the PDF, the most likely causes are:

1. These fields were optional in the submission
2. The venue organizers have decided to hide the field in review. If you believe this to be in error, please contact the venue organizers.
