# I am an Independent Researcher, how do I sign up?

We've received many emails from concerned researchers who want to sign up quickly but aren't affiliated with an academic institution.&#x20;

If you are not affiliated with an academic institution, but are employed at a company, you can use that domain and position information to sign up. You may need to request OpenReview add your company as an institutional domain.

If you do not have a company domain, you can use a personal email. All personal emails will be moderated - see [Expediting Profile Activation](../creating-an-openreview-profile/expediting-profile-activation.md) for additional tips on how to make sure your profile is activated as quickly as possible. &#x20;

When filling out the profile details for registration, there is a section that will ask for your Education and Career History, which will require a current position. For the role you can type “Independent Researcher” and set that as your current position and type in a domain.  See the page [Entering Institutional Data](../creating-an-openreview-profile/entering-institutional-data.md) for an example of how to fill out institutional information as an independent researcher. Please include as much of your background as possible. If the "Education and Career History" section only lists "Independent Researcher" we will ask you to add another institution record.

Please do not use an old role or affiliation as your current position, as that may delay moderation.
