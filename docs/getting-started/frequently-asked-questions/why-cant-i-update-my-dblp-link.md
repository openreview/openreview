# Why can't I update my DBLP link?

You can try the following steps to debug issues related to adding your DBLP link to your profile:

1. **Ensure that the DBLP link is properly formatted and uses the persistent URL** (see [here](../creating-an-openreview-profile/importing-papers-from-dblp.md) for more details about persistent URLs)
2. **Ensure that your DBLP link is a single author page.** If the link has a banner that states that it is a "disambiguation page", or if the link contains publications that belong to another researcher, contact DBLP directly to create a single author page. (See this [post](https://blog.dblp.org/2020/03/18/name-disambiguation-suffixes-in-dblp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by DBLP for more information)
3. **Check for previous profiles**. Sometimes users have previously created profiles with DBLP links. If you get an error stating another user is using your profile, check for previous accounts using past emails.
4. **Check for claimable profiles.** There are some profiles that have been pre-created by OpenReview. You can go to the [sign-up](https://openreview.net/signup) page and type the first and last name in the conflicting profile and check for claimable profiles.
5. **Contact support.** If none of the above steps work, contact us at info@openreview.net. Include your profile id, the DBLP link, and the error message you receive when you attempt to update your profile.
