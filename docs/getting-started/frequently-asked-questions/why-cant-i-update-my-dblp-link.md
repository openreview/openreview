# Why can't I update my DBLP link?

{% hint style="danger" %}
The DBLP staff cannot support the exceptionally high number of support and error correction requests they've received from authors submitting to venues hosted on OpenReview. It will currently take several weeks, if not months, to read and address requests. **Do not send your request multiple times**.
{% endhint %}

You can try the following steps to debug issues related to adding your DBLP link to your profile:

1. **Ensure that the DBLP link is properly formatted and uses the persistent URL** (see [here](../creating-an-openreview-profile/importing-papers-from-dblp.md) for more details about persistent URLs)
2. **Ensure that your DBLP link is a single author page.** If the link has a banner that states that it is a "disambiguation page", or if the link contains publications that belong to another researcher (See this [post](https://blog.dblp.org/2020/03/18/name-disambiguation-suffixes-in-dblp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by DBLP for more information) there will be issues with importing papers. Please see the above warning about contacting DBLP with correct requests.
3. **Check for previous profiles**. Sometimes users have previously created profiles with DBLP links. If you get an error stating another user is using your profile, check for previous accounts using past emails.
4. **Check for claimable profiles.** There are some profiles that have been pre-created by OpenReview. You can go to the [sign-up](https://openreview.net/signup) page and type the first and last name in the conflicting profile and check for claimable profiles.
5. **Contact support.** If none of the above steps work, please [Contact Us](https://openreview.net/contact). Include your profile id, the DBLP link, and the error message you receive when you attempt to update your profile.
