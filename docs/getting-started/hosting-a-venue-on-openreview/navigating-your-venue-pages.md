# Navigating your Venue Pages

After your venue is deployed, you will have access to multiple pages in OpenReview. These can be accessed through two methods:

1. Navigating to them from the Program Chair Console on the OpenReview website
2. Clicking the relevant link in the venue deployment confirmation email (subject: 'Your Venue is Deployed")

#### Venue Homepage

This is the public-facing page for your venue, and can be found under 'Active Venues' on the OpenReview homepage.

### Program Chair Console&#x20;

You can find a link to your PC console under ‘Active Consoles’ on the OpenReview homepage after you have logged into your account. Use this page to access your venue request form, committee consoles, and edge browser.&#x20;

#### Venue Request Form&#x20;

The venue request form contains the settings that were selected in your venue’s request form. You can get to the venue request form using the ‘Full venue configuration’ link at the bottom of your PC console. Almost all customizations, such as adding a Program Chair, review form modifications, deadline changes  and workflow stages, should be made through the venue request form.

#### Edge Browser

The edge browser is the place where PCs can see reviewers, papers, and the links between them. This is where PCs will typically go to see and modify assignments for roles like reviewers and area chairs. To see the edge browser, you will first need to run the [Paper Matching Setup](../../how-to-guides/paper-matching-and-assignment/) workflow stage, then you will see the link to '\[Role] Assignment' in your PC Console under the 'Timeline' section. Use that link to access the Edge Browser.

#### Committee Member Groups and Consoles&#x20;

Each type of committee member (Reviewers, Area Chairs, and Senior Area Chairs) for your venue will have their own console. You can access these consoles through each of the links under ‘Venue Roles’ at the bottom of your PC console. This link will take you to the group edit page, then you can use the 'View Group' button to see the console.
