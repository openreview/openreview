# Introduction to Edits

* [Technical Reference for Edits](../../reference/api-v2/entities/edit/)
* [How to create, edit, and delete notes](../../how-to-guides/workflow/how-to-create-change-and-delete-notes.md)

In OpenReview, an **Edit** is the object used for creating, modifying, or deleting entities (such as Notes, Groups, Edges, etc.). Edits are posted and then **applied via inference rules** defined by invitations.

See the[ API reference ](../../reference/api-v2/entities/edit/)for a comprehensive description of the fields of the Edit object. Most commonly, you will interact with the following key fields:

* `invitation`: ID of the invitation that governs the operation
* `signatures`: Who is performing the edit
* `note`: The data of the note (new content or modifications)
* `ddate`: A timestamp to **delete** a note (in ms time). The default value for this field is `None`

### Edits and Inference

Inference refers to **how the system processes edits**. The target invitation defines **what kind of edits are allowed**, **what metadata is required**, and **how the system responds** to them (e.g., assigning readers, creating edges, triggering workflows).&#x20;

* Invitations can specify a `process` function that determines side effects.
* The system checks permissions, field formats, and required values using the invitationâ€™s rules.

Below is an example of an edit to a review. The Edit object includes the metadata for the Edit, and nested within is the metadata and content for the [Note](introduction-to-notes.md) to be updated.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two different reader fields here - one for the Edit (outer layer) and one within the Note object which are the readers of the Note to update. When updating the readers, it is helpful to double-check that the correct values are being update.
{% endhint %}

```python
note_id = ''
edits = client_v2.get_note_edits(note_id)
edits
```
