# Using the API

There are currently two APIs supported. The current API (referred to in the documentation as API or API 2) is the current API version, and is the default version used for all operations unless otherwise specified.&#x20;



The legacy API v1 is being phased out, but is still used for some conferences (primarily those before 2024)

While most operations will work on both APIs, pay careful attention when that is not the case, for example, the JSON format for each API is different.
